      <description>Support Vector Machines (SVM) are seemingly derived from a intuitive concept, drawing a decision boundary with the widest margin (aka gutter, street, etc.). While this only really applies to the linear problem in which the data are indeed separable, I find it particularly helpful in visualizing the decision space of the model. Unlike a random forest or multi-layer neural network, it is easy to picture model space. While not a novel idea in the slightest, this provoked me to consider decision space for several classification algorithms to hopefully gain insight into other techniques, and with this insight select appropriate methods for future questions.</description>

      <title>P004 Swiss dog dataset suggest owners slightly prefer dog of the same gender, maybe</title>

      <description>I stumbled on this dataset on Kaggle of dogs and their owners in Switzerland. With a little help from google translation it becomes clear that there is a relatively substantial dataset of around 6,000 dogs and their owners including dog gender, dog breed, owner gender, owner age, and a few other bits of information. To practice working with pandas data frames and some simple regressions I entertained a few questions, such as, what is the most popular dog color?</description>

      <title>P002 Working with empirical orthogonal functions</title>

      <description>Today I was wondering if I can make some sense of a rather large 60-year hindcast of winds in Washington around the Salish Sea. Could I see what the typical wind patterns in the region are? How can I manage this with a rather hefty 1+GB set of spatial wind predictions? This is a good opportunity to explore empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), also known as principle component analysis (PCA).</description>

      <title>P001 Transitioning to data science</title>

      <description>This is the beginning of a data odyssey, re-tooling my background in oceanography to the rapidly evolving field of data science. After 10-years in the geosciences I am interested in pursuing something new, faster-paced, and more lucrative. I decided to write this blog, not necessarily expecting anyone to read it, but primarily for my own record keeping as I learn explore a new set of data analysis tools and whatever interesting datasets I can get my hands.</description>
